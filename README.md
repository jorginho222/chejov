# Flights Management API

A REST API for an airline booking system, built with NestJS, TypeORM and PostgreSQL. It manages airlines, airplanes, flights, seat reservations, passengers and orders. The Angular frontend lives in a separate repository, `flights-management-front`, and is expected next to this one at `../flights-management-front`.

The project is in development and is not deployed anywhere. Some parts are still incomplete; see [Work in progress](#work-in-progress).

## Tech stack

- **NestJS 11** on Node.js, written in TypeScript
- **TypeORM** with **PostgreSQL** (SQLite in memory for some tests)
- **class-validator** and **class-transformer** for request validation
- **Swagger** API docs, served at `/docs`
- **@nestjs/event-emitter** for side effects between modules, and **@nestjs-modules/mailer** for emails
- **AWS S3** for airplane file uploads
- **Jest** and **supertest** for tests
- **Docker Compose** for local development

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js 24 and npm (the Docker image uses Node 24)
- Docker with Docker Compose

### First run

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # then fill in the values you need, see Configuration
npm ci                  # install on the host first, see the note below
docker compose up -d    # starts the API, Postgres and Adminer
```

Run `npm ci` on the host **before** the first `docker compose up`. Otherwise Docker creates an empty `node_modules` owned by root as a mount point, and installs on the host fail with `EACCES`. To recover, stop the API, run `rmdir node_modules`, then run `npm ci`.

Once the containers are up:

| Service          | URL                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| API (hot reload) | http://localhost:3000           |
| Swagger UI       | http://localhost:3000/docs      |
| OpenAPI JSON     | http://localhost:3000/docs-json |
| Adminer (DB UI)  | http://localhost:8082           |
| Postgres         | `localhost:5433`                |

Postgres and Adminer use host ports 5433 and 8082 to avoid clashing with other local projects. Inside Compose, the database is still reachable at `db:5432`. The containers don't restart on their own, so start them again after a reboot.

### Working with the API container

The API container keeps its own `node_modules` in a named volume, separate from the host copy your IDE uses. After dependencies change, for example after a pull, update both:

```bash
npm ci
npm run docker:npm -- ci
```

Other helpers that run inside the container (it must be running):

```bash
npm run docker:install -- <package>   # npm install in the container
npm run docker:exec -- node -v        # run any command
npm run docker:shell                  # open a shell
npm run docker:logs                   # follow the API logs
```

## Configuration

Settings come from `.env`, with optional overrides in `.env.local`. Copy `.env.example`, which documents each variable.

| Variable                                                                            | Purpose                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ENVIRONMENT`                                                                       | `development` uses TypeORM `synchronize` with no SSL. Any other value, or unset, turns SSL on and runs pending migrations at boot. |
| `PORT`                                                                              | Port the API listens on (3000).                                                                                                    |
| `CORS_ORIGINS`                                                                      | Comma-separated origins allowed to call the API. Defaults to `http://localhost:4200`, the frontend.                                |
| `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`                                 | Credentials for the Postgres container.                                                                                            |
| `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`                           | Database connection for commands run on the host (`DB_PORT=5433`). Compose sets these for the API container itself.                |
| `AWS_S3_REGION`, `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | S3 storage for airplane files. The region must not be blank or the API crashes at startup.                                         |
| `APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`                                            | Optional. Leave empty to disable Application Insights.                                                                             |

### Searching flights with `QUERY`

Flight search uses the HTTP `QUERY` method, which works like `GET` but takes a request body. There is no `GET /flights`. Send the filters as JSON. All are optional: `origin`, `destination`, `departureFrom`, `departureTo`, `status`, `airlineCode`, `page` and `limit` (20 by default).

```bash
curl -X QUERY http://localhost:3000/flights \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"origin": "Buenos Aires", "page": 1, "limit": 20}'
```

The bundled Swagger UI can't display `QUERY` operations, so this endpoint is missing from `/docs`, though it is in `/docs-json`.

### Spreadsheet imports

`POST /airlines/import` and `POST /airplanes/import` take an .xlsx file in the `file` form field. Columns are matched by their header, and every row is validated. The import saves all rows or none: if any row is invalid, the response lists the errors by row and column. Sample files are in `data/`.

## How it works

### Architecture

- **Business rules live on the entities**, and services orchestrate: they load entities, call methods on them and save. For example, `Flight.reserveSeat` and `Order.calculateTotal`.
- **Services are split by use case** rather than one per module. Flights has `FlightsUpsertService`, `FlightsSearchService` and `FlightsReserveService`.
- **Side effects between modules use events.** For example, reserving a seat emits `flight.reserved`, and a subscriber in the passengers module emails the passenger.

### Flights and seats

- When a flight is created, its seats are generated from the airplane's seat configuration (rows and columns per class) and stored as a JSON array on the flight.
- Reserving a seat sets the passenger on that seat and adds the passenger to the flight. The flight row is locked during the reservation, so two passengers can't take the same seat.
- Changing a flight's schedule marks it as delayed or advanced.

### Flight codes

Each flight gets a unique code made of the airline's two-character code and a correlative number, for example `AL1`, `AL2`. When a flight is created, the airline row is locked and the next number is the highest existing one for that prefix plus one. A unique index on the code backs this up, and a clash returns `409 Conflict`.

### Order pricing

An order's grand total combines:

- **Flights:** the flight's base price plus the airline's percentage increment for the chosen class, times the number of tickets.
- **Luggage:** charged per flight using the airline's luggage rules.
- **Miles redemption:** costs `distance × redeemed quantity` miles, plus the airline's redeem fee.

Money is stored as `numeric(12,2)` and rounded to 2 decimals.

## Database and migrations

In development (`ENVIRONMENT=development`), TypeORM `synchronize` updates the schema from the entities, so schema changes work locally without a migration. Migrations still go in `src/migration/` and run against the local database:

```bash
npm run migration:generate -- src/migration/<Name>   # generate from entity changes
npm run migration:run                                # apply pending migrations
npm run migration:revert                             # undo the last one
```

Migrations load from `dist/src/migration/`. The API container's watch mode keeps `dist/` compiled, so run them while the container is up instead of building first.

New entities must be added to the `entities` array in `ormConfig.ts`.

## Testing

```bash
npm test                                    # all specs under src/
npm test -- src/flights/flights.upsert.service.spec.ts   # one file
npm test -- --testNamePattern="test name"   # tests matching a name
npm run test:watch
npm run test:cov
```

Running the whole suite in parallel can use a lot of memory, so add `--maxWorkers=1` if your machine struggles.

- **Unit specs** sit next to the code they test and mock repositories.
- **Co-located e2e specs** (`*.e2e.spec.ts`) start the module with an in-memory SQLite database and call it with supertest. `npm test` runs them; `npm run test:e2e` only runs the specs in `test/`.
- **Postgres-only behavior:** SQLite supports neither the row locks nor some of the Postgres SQL used when creating a flight or reserving a seat. The concurrency tests for these are listed as pending in `src/flights/flights.concurrency.e2e.spec.ts` until there is a Postgres test database.

## Project structure

```
src/
  airlines/     airlines, luggage rules, price increments, xlsx import
  airplanes/    airplanes, seat configuration, xlsx import, S3 files
  flights/      flights, seats, codes, search and reservations
  orders/       orders and pricing
  passengers/   passengers and the event subscribers (emails, miles)
  users/        users, which are passengers with accumulated miles
  shared/       CORS, money helpers, database errors, S3, spreadsheet import
  migration/    TypeORM migrations
data/           sample .xlsx files for the imports
ormConfig.ts    database configuration, also used by the migration CLI
```

Each module uses `dto/`, `entities/`, `valueObjects/`, `types/`, `events/` and `subscribers/` as needed. File names are lowercase and dot-separated, such as `flights.reserve.service.ts`.

## Code quality

```bash
npm run lint      # ESLint, with auto-fix
npm run format    # Prettier
```

## Work in progress

- Cancelling and updating orders are not implemented yet.
- Some events are incomplete: nothing emits `order.paid`, and the miles and flight-cancelled subscribers are not registered.
- Cancelling a seat leaves the passenger on the flight.
- Many not-found errors return HTTP 500 instead of 404.
- There are no concurrency tests against Postgres yet.

## Deployment

The app is not deployed. The repository still contains a GitHub Actions workflow for an Azure Web App, but it is not in use.
